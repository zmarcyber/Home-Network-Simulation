# Home-Network-Simulation
This project created a simple home network using Cisco packet tracer. Of course, in today's day and age, there are more complex home networks, but this covers the basics. 

This simulation has a home network with two laptops, PCs, switches, and router. 

The laptops are connected to the router after removing the Cisco Gigabit Ethernet port and installing a network interface card that is suitable for wireless connections such as 802.11ac or 802.11b/g/n

The two PCs are connected to two switches using a copper straight-through cable, and the switches are then connected to the router using a copper cross-over cable. 

To know the network is up and running, you have green triangles from the PCs to the switch to the router showing an active connection, and the laptops have a wireless connection to the router. 

Note: The laptops along with PCs were assigned a static IP address.
